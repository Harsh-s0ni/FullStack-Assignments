Milestone Exam Project Readme

Welcome to the Milestone Exam Project repository! This collection of projects showcases the skills and creativity of mine in developing a range of web-pages. Below you'll find important information about each project, including their responsiveness and recommended viewing environments.

Project 1: Responsive Design

Project 1 has been designed with responsiveness in mind. It adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices.

Project 2, 3, 4, and 5: Desktop Viewing

Projects 2 through 5 are best viewed on desktops with full-width screens. These projects are optimized for desktop usage and might not provide an ideal experience on smaller screens.
